## Gate 0 (opportunities) checklist

__Problem(s)__

The core problem/issue that customers are experiencing, and that we want to try solve.

__What's already in the market (ie existing alternatives)

Products or services already in the market.

__Value proposition__

How what we're building is different from existing offers, and why people would want to use/purchase it.

__Competitive advantage__

OPTIONAL. Our/the product's competitive advantage over existing alternatives.

__Customers, possibly early adopters__

Potential customer groups/segments, including those who might be involved in early development/adoption of the product.

__Revenue streams__

OPTIONAL. How the product earns money / the sources of the product's earnings.

__Channels__

How we'll reach potential / existing customers.

__Solution(s)__

Potential solution(s) to the problem(s), taking into account all of the above factors.


### Criteria (_how_ it's considered)

__Team review__

The team will review and give their feedback on the initial lean canvas. How can we break thsi down to a smaller opportunity. Could this be dependant on another venture which could be created as a spin off

__Board: conflict of interest__

The board examines each venture, identifying potential conflicts of interest and (if necessary) vetoing any potentially problematic ventures, or changing a venture's direction.


## Gate 1 (lean canvas) checklist

__A completed lean canvas (as much as is possible - living documents so we should expect them to change)__

All fields to be filled in.

__Potential/actual collaborators identified__

Focus on end users - validate the problem and need (see questions below). Be discrete - the names of organisations, not their sector. We're validating the canvases, so try to choose appropriate people to validate with (eg not just random people in the street, but people who know about this stuff, etc).

__Problem validated with at least 3 potential end users (ie 3 humans)__

Questions to ask of each potential end user:

* [Problem] Here's what we understand of the problem people are facing. What do you think? Is this something you've encountered? What are we missing?

* [Solution] Here's what we think could help solve these problems. What do you think? Is it too complicated, or too simple? What are we missing?

* [Advantage] Is there anyone else out there that offers this, or that you're talking with?

* [Revenue streams] What does it currently cost you to solve this problem (if you are)?

* [Key metrics] How do/would you know if your problem is getting better?

* [Channels] Are you part of any industry or professional groups?

What would your peers think of this venture?

Is this something you'd like to be involved in?

And finally, do you know anyone else who has this problem?

__Data sources (potential or actual) identified__

Ideally, actual data source names - vague is less good, but acceptable. And only if the venture requires data.

__Riskiest assumption__

Thing most likely to fail, or least known about.

__All canvases put in front of team for feedback, and approved by team after feedback incorporation__

This is when scoring happens, too.

__Venture lead identified (per venture, for continuity)__

Single point of contact for the venture.

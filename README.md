# Data Ventures

We are the commercial arm of Stats NZ with a focus on partnering with private organisations.

## Vision

A place where data is no longer part of the conversation.

We see a future where the road blocks behind accessing data are gone, and the value of data is at a place where it’s understood it’s about what you do with it, not sell it.


## Mission

We bring together partners from across sectors to create ventures that deliver economic and social benefit for Aotearoa New Zealand.
